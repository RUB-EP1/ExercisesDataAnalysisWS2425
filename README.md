Welcome to the exercises for the "Data Analysis in HEP" lecture! :wave:

In these exercises you will work through the statistical aspects of a typical data analysis in high energy physics. You will be equipped with a unique data set that resembles real data taken with the [LHCb experiment](https://lhcb-outreach.web.cern.ch/).

During the course, you will develop a code base for this analysis in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) starting from scratch.

Before getting started with the exercises, you will need to follow the [setup](exercises/setup.md) steps to prepare the software environment on your machine.

## Lecture Material

Code for the notebooks showcased at the lectures can be found in the [lectures/](lectures/) folder.
The github link can be used for the path link in Pluto starting page.

## Exercises

The exercise sheets are distributed on Wednesday of the tutorial, and due on Sunday 1.5 weeks later.
Solution of the problems and the code should be send to <Dhruvanshu.Parmar@ruhr-uni-bochum.de> (link to a code, pdf of a notebook).
