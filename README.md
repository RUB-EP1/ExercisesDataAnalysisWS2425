Welcome to the exercises for the "Data Analysis in HEP" lecture! :wave:

In these exercises you will work through the statistical aspects of a typical data analysis in high energy physics. You will be equipped with a unique data set that resembles real data taken with the [LHCb experiment](https://lhcb-outreach.web.cern.ch/).

During the course, you will develop a code base for this analysis in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) starting from scratch.

Before getting started with the exercises, you will need to follow the [setup](exercises/setup.md) steps to prepare the software environment on your machine.

## Technical notes

### Pre-commit

This repository uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to check the code and text.
To run the checks locally,

```bash
pre-commit run -a
```
