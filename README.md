Welcome to the exercises for the "Data Analysis in HEP" lecture! :wave: 

In these exercises you will work through the statistical aspects of a typical data analysis in high energy physics. You will be equipped with a unique data set that resembles real data taken with the [LHCb experiment](https://lhcb-outreach.web.cern.ch/).

During the course, you will develop a code base for this analysis in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) starting from scratch.

Before getting started with the exercises, you will need to prepare the software environment on your machine (see [setup.md](setup.md) in this repository).
