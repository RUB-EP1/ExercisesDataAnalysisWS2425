# Sheet 4: Hypothesis testing

It is now time to estimate whether the hypothesized signal for the $\Xi_c^+ \rightarrow \Xi^- K^+ \pi^+$ decay process is statistically significant.

## Exercise 1

Given your dataset, estimate the $p$-value of the background-only hypothesis, using a test statistic with the Poisson distribution the central 1$\,\sigma$ of the Gaussian signal.

## Exercise 2

Compute the same $p$-value with a likelihood-based test statistic.

## Exercise 3

At the time of the Higgs discovery, the ATLAS and CMS collaborations used the "Brazil flag" plot to show the significance of the signal (see e.g. [ATLAS figure from CERN library reference](https://cds.cern.ch/record/1406059)). The plot shows the local significance of the Higgls signal as a function of the mass of the Higgs boson. The local significance is defined as the number of standard deviations of the signal over the square root of the number of expected background events.
In this exercise, we break down technical details of the construction.

- translate notion of null hypothesis, and alternative hypothesis to the context of $\Xi^- K^+ \pi^+$ production process.
- define analogue of $95\%\,\text{CL}$ for $\sigma_\text{sig} / \sigma_\text{SM}$.
- For 10 selected points around $\Xi_c^+$ mass, compute the $1\,\sigma$ and $2\,\sigma$ confidence bands using simulations
- plot a curve for the observed cross section on top.
