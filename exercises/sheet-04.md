# Sheet 4: Hypothesis testing

It is now time to estimate whether the hypothesized signal for the $\Xi_c^+ \rightarrow \Xi^- K^+ \pi^+$ decay process is statistically significant.

## Exercise 1

Given your dataset, estimate the $p$-value of the background-only hypothesis, using a test statistic with the Poisson distribution the central 1$\,\sigma$ of the Gaussian signal.

## Exercise 2

Compute the same $p$-value with a likelihood-based test statistic.

## Exercise 3

Brazilian band plots? What is the expected number of signal events?
